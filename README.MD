# Game of Life

This interactive animation is based on one of the first and best known examples of cellular automation, created by British mathematician John Conway.


The Game of Life is a *zero-player game* that develops on the basis of its original state.

The user is asked at the beginning of the game to choose board dimensions.

The application displays a board with the start animation (glider), and the user can turn on and off individual fields with the click of a mouse.

With the two buttons (PLAY/PAUSE) the user can stop the animation, change its state and turn it on again.

## The basic assumptions of the game:

* Cells arise and die on a two-dimensional board, and their state depends on their environment (eight cells which are their neighbors):
    * every live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies by underpopulation,
    * every live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation,
    * every live cell with more than three live neighbors dies by overpopulation,
    * every dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell again.
